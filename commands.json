The high value causes a voltage drop, which results in about 0.8V at the BOOT0 pin on the chip. This voltage is not high enough to be recognized as a logic high. This means the board will not enter the bootmode. Potential fix: desolder the resistor and solder a new one with a value close to 10k. Example:",
