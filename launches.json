        "description": "This return to flight mission for Capella Space carries Sequoia - a 100 kg class radar imaging microsatellite that will be positioned in a 45-degree inclination. This mid-inclination allows to give customers immediate access to rapid coverage of important regions, including the Middle East, Korea, Japan, Europe, South East Asia, Africa, and the U.S. Like all of Capella satellites, Sequoia will be able to see through clouds and in the dark and detect sub-0.5 meter changes on Earth\u2019s surface. When fully deployed, Capella's satellite constellation will offer hourly coverage of every point on Earth.\n\nThe name of the mission is a nod to the infamous advertisement campaign for \u201cI Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter.\u201d",
